# MapProject

If you are going to run this project, make sure to insert your Google API key in mapproject.html and that it has the Maps Javascript API and Places API enabled.

Simply type something that will return a Google place result, such as ‘Manchester’ or ‘Leeds’. The map will then display all results with ‘McDonald’s’ in their name in a 500m radius, the markers are clickable with an infowindow showing their full name. If the query does not return a place result, or there are no McDonald’s in that area, then appropriate messages will be shown.
